In this section, we will complete the following environment preparations.

- Node.js
- npm
- Zeus CLI
- TUN/TAP Network for simulator

We provide two ways to prepare the environment. We recommend using the env-setup-script provided by Zepp OS for one-click installation, or following the documentation to prepare the environment manually.

## Install the environment using the env-setup-script script

### Download the env-setup-script project

The developer downloads the corresponding installation packages according to different operating systems.

- [Win10-11](https://bundle-cdn.huami.com/20231024/win10-11.zip)
- [MacOS](https://bundle-cdn.huami.com/20231024/macos.zip)
- [Linux](https://bundle-cdn.huami.com/20231024/linux.zip)

Project source code is hosted at [Zepp Health Github env-setup-script](https://github.com/zepp-health/env-setup-script).

### Executing script

During this phase, the procedure varies depending on the operating system being used. Therefore, please refer to the relevant sections for your specific operating system.

Execute the script, you can complete the installation of the environment, when the script appears the following prompt indicates that the installation is successful.

#### Windows

In Windows, it is recommended to use the built-in `PowerShell` terminal to execute commands as an administrator.

Go to the `/win10-11` directory and execute the `. \env-helper.ps1` command.

```sh
.\env-helper.ps1
```

:::info
If you encounter an error message like this.

```sh
File .\env-helper.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

+ CategoryInfo : SecurityError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

The script doesnâ€™t run because the PowerShell Execution Policy is set to the default of Restricted.
```

Please execute the following command in the terminal first:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

And then run the script again.

:::

#### macOS

In macOS, it is recommended to use the built-in `Terminal` or `iTerm2` to execute commands.

Go to the `/macOS` directory and execute the script.

```sh
cd macOS
bash env-helper.sh
```

:::info
- If prompted for a password, enter the current user's password and confirm it.

```sh

```
- If you get this error, manually grant permissions in Privacy and Security in System Preferences.
- For Apple Silicon models, please refer to the [Enable System Extensions or Kernel Extension on Apple Silicon Mac](../../guides/faq/apple-silicon.md) for setup first.

#### Linux

In Linux, it is recommended to use the built-in `Terminal` terminal to execute commands.

Go to the `/linux` directory and execute the script.

```sh
cd linux
bash env-helper.sh
```
